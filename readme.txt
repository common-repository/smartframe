Secure images with watermark, disable right click, enable zoom or fullscreen. Compress images without losing quality.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to optimize how images are displayed and adds the following features:

* **The best image security on the internet** - add image watermark, prevent right-click and screenshot, prevent hotlinking, prevent image theft, add copyright notice appearing directly on the image on an attempt to copy or download it. Images are completely invisible to malicious bots.
* **Faster and more responsive images** - automatically compress JPEG images and speed up WordPress. Always load the image in the appropriate quality and size for the display device.
* **Image zoom and full screen viewing** - allow 100% zoom on image without a negative impact on your page speed, also in full screen mode.
* **Embed images with configurable buttons and an image caption** - add share buttons, full-screen mode and interactive text over image, which is retained even if the image is embedded on another website.

### SMART IMAGE OPTIMIZATION ###

With the SmartFrame WordPress Image Security and Compression Plugin, you don't need to choose between image quality and page speed. SmartFrame uses a proprietary algorithm to compress JPG images and maintain page load speeds. Whenever a page with embedded SmartFrames is loaded, it reduce images size and renders your image in the highest needed resolution, based on the device used (retina images). This means that images displayed on the average smartphone or tablet, for example, will be rendered at a lower resolution than on a Retina display.

SmartFrame will never upscale your images, so you should make sure that the images you initially upload to the SmartFrame Cloud are in a high enough resolution to look good across all devices. The size and resolution of the original image will not affect the page loading speed, although low-resolution images aren’t ideal for display on high-resolution displays, and these may also limit the performance of the Hyper Zoom feature.

### SECURITY AND COPYRIGHT PROTECTION ###

Do you want to protect images? SmartFrame offers far more than simple right click protection. Here's what happens when you publish an image on your website via SmartFrame:

1. The original image is uploaded and stored securely in the SmartFrame Cloud. You maintain the image's copyright and you can access, replace or remove it at any time.
1. An encrypted version of the image is then published on your website.
1. The image can only be decrypted by the SmartFrame Viewer, which is added to your website when you publish an image using the SmartFrame plugin.
1. Your image is then rendered directly onto HTML canvas in the end-user's browser.

This technology means that your images are protected not only from right-click and common screenshot attempts, but they cannot be found in the source code either. This anti theft protection will discourage most users from stealing your images, but it will also protect you from any malicious web crawlers that may try to scrape your content.


### HYPER ZOOM ###

SmartFrame's Hyper Zoom feature allows you to zoom right up to the original size of the image. The technology renders the image anew with every zoom level, so the initial loading speed is not affected.

Hyper Zoom is also optimized for mobile and tablet viewing, where it is accessed through a pinch gesture instead of tapping. It works in the same way as on a desktop, with the image rendered at a higher resolution with each pinch.


### BUTTON OVER IMAGE AND CAPTIONING ###
#### SHARE BUTTON ####

Sharing your images doesn’t mean risking their security; SmartFrame’s Share button allows images to be shared on your terms. It’s never the original image that’s being shared, only its encrypted SmartFramed counterpart, which means that any caption and copyright information included in your SmartFrame are also passed along, wherever the image is shared.

Pro Tip: SmartFrame tracks where and when your images are being shared. You can access this data in the Insights section of the SmartFrame Admin Panel.


#### CAPTIONS ####

Every time you add an image to your website via SmartFrame, you can add a custom image caption to it. Depending on the Theme you select, caption inside image will be placed on top of it all times (Security Theme) or only on a mouseover action (Presentation Theme).

#### FULL-SCREEN BUTTON ####

If you enable the Full-screen button, your images will be available to view in fullscreen mode. Since the full screen image is only rendered in a high resolution once someone clicks this button, this feature does not affect the page load speed.

### SMARTFRAME CLOUD ###

The SmartFrame plugin uses a fast and reliable cloud service to process, encrypt and reduce image size. This allows images to be encrypted and displayed quickly and securely in any geographical location. The cloud, which is a custom implementation of an Amazon Web Services platform, features autoscaling, load balancing, frequent backups, 24/7 monitoring and 99.9% availability, and is used by many large international companies.

To store images in the cloud, users simply need to register for a SmartFrame account, which is free of charge for up to 2GB of images. This can be upgraded to Pro or Enterprise plans for more demanding users. Registration also gives you access to the SmartFrame Admin Panel, which offers many additional tools. [Read more about the features here](https://smartframe.io/?utm_campaign=WordPress%20Plugin%20v2.2.0&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=WordPress%20Plugin%20Page&utm_content=Features).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is the SmartFrame plugin really free? =

Yes, the plugin itself is completely free to use, regardless of the SmartFrame plan selected. The most basic SmartFrame plan is the Free plan, which includes 2GB storage space for your images. Should you want to increase this and/or remove SmartFrame branding from your images, you’ll need to upgrade to a paid-for SmartFrame Pro plan. [You can read more about SmartFrame pricing here](https://smartframe.io/pricing?utm_campaign=WordPress%20Plugin%20v2.2.0&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=WordPress%20Plugin%20Page&utm_content=Pricing).

= Which image formats does SmartFrame support? =

SmartFrame currently supports JPEG images.

= What happens to the SmartFrame images when you deactivate or delete the plugin? =

If you deactivate or delete the SmartFrame plugin, your images are instantly converted to the original file format and will remain visible on your website.

= Do I need to create a SmartFrame account to use this plugin? =

You don’t need to create a SmartFrame account to use this plugin, although creating an account will give you access to many additional features such as Theme management and data tracking. You will always be able to use the plugin directly from WordPress, however, regardless of whether you have an account.

SmartFrame Technologies Ltd is a European, GDPR-compliant business; your privacy and personal information is protected at all times. Registration details are only collected for the purpose of servicing your account. We will never share or sell your data.

= Where can I get the access code? =

If you already have a SmartFrame account and want to connect it to the WordPress plugin, you can find the access key in the SmartFrame Admin Panel (**My Account > Integrations**). Simply paste this code on the plugin page and your SmartFrame account will be linked to your WordPress account.

If you don’t have a SmartFrame account and you want to create one, you can start the registration directly from the SmartFrame plugin.

= What is the difference between SmartFrame and other content security plugins? =

Most content security plugins disable right-click actions and some keyboard shortcuts using JavaScript, which leaves the original image file visible in the source code. This will discourage most users from trying to download your content, but it’s still fairly easy for a more tech-savvy user to gain access to your original images.

SmartFrame adds a whole new layer of security to your images. Not only are right-click actions and keyboard shortcuts blocked, but the image is also encrypted and cannot be found in source code. This protects your images from most download attempts as well as web crawlers that may want to scrape your content.

= What is the difference between SmartFrame and other image-compression plugins? =

Unlike most image-compression solutions, the SmartFrame plugin doesn’t change the size or quality of your original image. Instead, every time you publish an image using the SmartFrame plugin, it’s displayed on your page in the appropriate size and resolution for the device used to display it. That means that when displaying an image on the average smartphone, it will typically be loaded at a much smaller resolution than on a high-resolution computer display.

= Can I use SmartFrame only on some of my images? =

Yes. When using the SmartFrame plugin you can opt to use it for all images that you upload, or decide to use it for a particular image by excluding the CSS class in the SmartFrame Settings page.

You can also decide which SmartFrame features are available on a particular image by using SmartFrame’s Themes. As a WordPress plugin user, you can select one of three existing themes, but if you sign up for a SmartFrame account and decide to use the [SmartFrame Admin panel](https://panel.smartframe.io/login?utm_campaign=WordPress%20Plugin%20v2.2.0&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=WordPress%20Plugin%20Page&utm_content=SmartFrame%20Panel) you will be able to create your own bespoke Themes.

= Will SmartFrame have a negative impact on my SEO? =

SmartFrame has no negative effect on your SEO ranking. All images converted to SmartFrames will remain visible to search engine crawlers as small JPEG thumbnails. You can adjust these settings in the Control section of the SmartFrame Admin Panel.

= Does the plugin work on all major browsers? =

SmartFrame is fully compatible with Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Microsoft Edge browsers. [You can find more information here](https://smartframe.io/support/supported-browsers?utm_campaign=WordPress%20Plugin%20v2.2.0&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=WordPress%20Plugin%20Page&utm_content=Supported%20Browsers).

= How can I remove the "SmartFrame" label from my images? =

If you started using the plugin without registering through the SmartFrame website first, simply click **Register** on the left-hand-side panel and register for a new SmartFrame account. You will then be able to remove this branding by clicking **Remove SmartFrame logo** on the Settings page.

= Why do I still see tags within the text editor in WordPress? =

You will always see tags as regular images in the Wordpress editor, but they are converted to SmartFrames once the page is published. There will be no tags in the source code of the live page and the encrypted SmartFrame will be rendered by its proprietary script.
